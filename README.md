# Kitchen Kiosk
A family-centric household planning hub. Intended to be run either on a Rasperry Pi or at least through a touch-enabled screen via a browser on a Raspberry Pi.

The interface will feature an Angular.js and Twitter Bootstrap driven dashboard. All data for the dashboard will be sent and retrieved via the fully stateless RESTful API.

This system will interface with Google Calendar, email accounts, Facebook, various other social media utilities, automation services such as ifttt.com (If This Then That,) and a myriad of other external services in order to help bring the busy and hectic lives of a modern family together. 

## Highlighted Features ##

* Schedule family/household events and meetings
* Set and track personal goals
* Track personal and/or household finances
* Define and monitor chores, along with integrated reward/allowance system
* View notes, reminders, quotes, pictures in screensaver mode
* Receive notifications through any optional integrated system

## Home Automation ##

The Kitchen Kiosk is also intended to be a home automation command center. Interfacing with a phant.io (http://phant.io/) server such as at http://data.sparkfun.com, Kiosk can retrieve and aggregate "Internet of Things" data pertinent to a home. Depending upon the data sensors available, Kitchen Kiosk can display the history of and current status of:

* Indoor and outdoor temperature
* Humidity and other weather conditions
* Fire, smoke, and carbon monoxide monitoring
* Electricity and water consumption
* Soil moisture and sprinkler system history
* Doorbell usage
* Much, much, much, much more!

It is not read only! Any good home automation system of course automates things; controls lights, garage doors, security systems. Utilizing the many abilities of the Raspberry Pi and automation services like ifttt.com, Kitchen Kiosk is able to act as a centralized hub for an entire household.
